# hello-world

My name is Peri and I'm a Junior in CS with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
I have had experience with Java, using it exclusively for classes and my robotics team before coming to college.
When not coding my life away, I enjoy all things having to do with music, playing video games, swimming, dancing, and being with friends.
